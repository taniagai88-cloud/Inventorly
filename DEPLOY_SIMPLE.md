## Method: Vercel CLI (Easiest!)

### Step 1: Install Vercel

**On Mac:**
1. Open "Terminal" (search for it in Spotlight)
2. Copy and paste this, press Enter:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```
3. Wait for it to finish (might take 1-2 minutes)

**On Windows:**
1. Open "Command Prompt" (search for "cmd")
2. Copy and paste this, press Enter:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```
3. Wait for it to finish (might take 1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Go to Your Project Folder

**On Mac:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/inventorly-app
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
cd C:\path\to\your\inventorly-app
```

**Tip:** You can drag the folder into Terminal/Command Prompt to get the path!

### Step 3: Deploy!

Type this and press Enter:
```bash
vercel
```

### Step 4: Answer the Questions

Vercel will ask you some questions. Here's what to answer:

**Question 1:**
```
? Set up and deploy "~/inventorly-app"? (Y/n)
```
**Your answer:** Press `Y` then Enter

---

**Question 2:**
```
? Which scope do you want to deploy to?
```
**Your answer:** Use arrow keys to select your account, press Enter

(If you don't have an account, it will ask you to sign up - use your email!)

---

**Question 3:**
```
? Link to existing project? (y/N)
```
**Your answer:** Press `N` then Enter

---

**Question 4:**
```
? What's your project's name? (inventorly-app)
```
**Your answer:** Just press Enter (accepts the default name)

**Question 5:**
```

**Question 6:**
```

```
**Your answer:** Press `N` then Enter

---

### Step 5: Wait...

You'll see a lot of text scrolling by. That's normal! Vercel is:
- Uploading your files
- Installing dependencies
- Building your app
- Deploying to the internet

This takes about 2-3 minutes. ⏱️

---

### Step 6: Success! 🎉

When it's done, you'll see:
```
✅ Preview: https://inventorly-app-abc123.vercel.app
```

**This is your app's URL!** Click it or copy it into your browser.

---

### Step 7: Make It "Live" (Production)

Right now you have a "preview" version. To make it the official "live" version:

Type this and press Enter:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

Wait 1-2 minutes, and you'll get:
```
✅ Production: https://inventorly-app.vercel.app
```

**This is your official URL!** Share it with anyone! 🎊
