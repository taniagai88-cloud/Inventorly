    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  },
  "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/inventorly"
}
```

## 🏢 Option 4: Traditional Hosting (cPanel, etc.)

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Navigate to the `dist/` folder
2. Upload all contents to your server's public directory
3. Your app is live!

**Server Requirements:**
- Static file hosting (no Node.js required)
- HTTPS recommended
- Gzip compression recommended

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables (If Needed)

If you add any API keys or secrets later, use environment variables:

**Vercel/Netlify:**
Add in dashboard under "Environment Variables"

**Local Development:**
Create `.env` file:
```
VITE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Access in code:
```typescript
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY;
```

---

## 📊 Performance Tips

Your app is already optimized, but for even better performance:

### 1. Enable Compression
Most platforms do this automatically (Vercel, Netlify)

### 2. Add Analytics (Optional)
```bash
# Vercel Analytics
npm i @vercel/analytics

# Add to App.tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <YourApp />
      <Analytics />
    </>
  );
}
```

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Vercel: Built-in analytics dashboard
- Netlify: Built-in analytics
- Google Analytics: Add tracking code

---

## 🔒 Security Checklist
