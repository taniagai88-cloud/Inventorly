## 🎯 Method 1: Deploy via GitHub (RECOMMENDED)

**Best for:** Teams, continuous deployment, version control

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (Skip if you have one)

8. ✅ Your code is now on GitHub!

**Option B: Using Command Line**
```bash
# In your project folder, run:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Inventorly app"

# Create a new repository on GitHub.com first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inventorly-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ⚡ Method 2: Deploy via CLI (Faster)

**Best for:** Quick deployments, no Git needed

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Wait for it to install...

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd path/to/your/inventorly-app
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
vercel
```

### Step 4: Follow the Prompts

**First time using Vercel CLI?**

```
> Set up and deploy "~/inventorly-app"?
👉 Press Y (Yes)

> Which scope do you want to deploy to?
👉 Select your account (use arrow keys, press Enter)

> Link to existing project?
👉 Press N (No)

> What's your project's name?
👉 Press Enter (accepts "inventorly-app")

> In which directory is your code located?
👉 Press Enter (accepts "./")

> Want to override the settings?
👉 Press N (No)
```

### Step 5: Wait for Deployment
You'll see:
```
🔍 Inspect: https://vercel.com/...
✅ Preview: https://inventorly-app-xyz.vercel.app
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Production
After testing your preview, run:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

This deploys to your production URL!

## 🌐 Add a Custom Domain (Optional)

Want `inventorly.app` instead of `inventorly-app.vercel.app`?

### Step 1: Buy a Domain
- Namecheap: https://namecheap.com
- Google Domains: https://domains.google
- GoDaddy: https://godaddy.com

Cost: ~$10-15/year

### Step 2: Add Domain to Vercel
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Click **"Domains"** in the sidebar
4. Click **"Add"**
5. Enter your domain: `inventorly.app`
6. Click **"Add"**

### Step 3: Update DNS Records
Vercel will show you instructions like:

```
Add these DNS records to your domain provider:

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Step 4: Add Records to Your Domain Provider
1. Log in to Namecheap/Google Domains/etc.
2. Find "DNS Settings" or "Manage DNS"
3. Add the A record
4. Add the CNAME record
5. Save changes

### Step 5: Wait for DNS Propagation
- Takes 5 minutes to 24 hours (usually ~15 minutes)
- Vercel will automatically add SSL certificate
- Visit your domain: `https://inventorly.app`
- ✅ **You're live on your custom domain!**

## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

**Good news!** If you used Method 1 (GitHub):

- Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel automatically deploys
- You get a preview URL for every branch
- Main branch = production URL
- Other branches = preview URLs

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make changes to your code
# ...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Updated dashboard design"
git push

# Vercel automatically deploys in 2 minutes!
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Failed - "Command not found"
**Fix:** Make sure `package.json` has these scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

### Build Failed - "Dependencies error"
**Fix:** Delete `node_modules` and redeploy:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh install"
git push
```

### Images Not Loading
**Fix:** Check that all images use correct imports. The app should work as-is since you're using the `figma:asset` paths.

### Blank Page After Deploy
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Usually a routing issue - your `vercel.json` should fix this (it's already configured!)

### "Cannot GET /" Error
Your `vercel.json` file should have this (already included):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables Not Working
If you add environment variables later:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add your variables
4. Redeploy

## 📊 Monitor Your App

### View Analytics (Free!)
1. In Vercel dashboard → Your project
2. Click **"Analytics"** tab
